## Description

The application asks the user to input the name of the audio file to input, which must be in .wav format. It then cuts silences longer than 1 second, although the duration can be modified easily within the code.

### Known issues
- The application needs a lot of memory for bigger files
- Lowering the duration of the minimum silence allowed can introduce distorsion in the output file

### Coming up...
- Fix of the known issues
- Multiple input files
- Support for other audio formats
